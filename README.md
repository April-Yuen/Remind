## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, EJS, MongoDB, Mongoose

This project was a cumulative effort over the course of several months. The team constantly met and refined approaches, and made tweaks and adjustments when necessary. In it's currrent state, the app is complete, but there is always room for improvement. As new ideas or understandings of new technologies surface, the team may meet to make suggestions for further adjustments and optimizations. 


## Lessons Learned:

What did we learn with this project? Developed a deeper understanding of MVC architecture. Grew an appreciation for Tailwind CSS, and became more comfortable with using auth in our apps.
