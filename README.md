# üöÄ Getting Started
## üíª Install

- Fork and clone the repository to your local computer.
- Complete and store `.env` file in the `server/config` folder
    - [(See .env template setup instructions)](https://github.com/April-Yuen/Remind/wiki/02---Onboarding#development-machine-setup) (We'll need to create this... )
- `npm install` in the root folder, which installs the required dependencies.
- And, `npm run dev` in the root folder. 
<!-- This starts the front-end and back-end in one terminal. -->
- This runs a local instance of mongodb. You can connect to it by connecting to `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/` with any MongoDB client like [Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass).

<!--  Do we want to add a help section to assist people launching the app? Will we add a channle in the discord to discuss with them? Or is this unneccassary for this project?

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, EJS, MongoDB, Mongoose

This project was a cumulative effort over the course of several months. The team constantly met and refined approaches, and made tweaks and adjustments when necessary. In it's currrent state, the app is complete, but there is always room for improvement. As new ideas or understandings of new technologies surface, the team may meet to make suggestions for further adjustments and optimizations. 


## Lessons Learned:

What did we learn with this project? Developed a deeper understanding of MVC architecture. Grew an appreciation for Tailwind CSS, and became more comfortable with using auth in our apps.



# Installation:

1. Download or clone the repo onto your local machine.
2. In your terminal, enter `npm install` to download and install the dependencies.
3. Use MongoDB to create a database:
    1. Create an account.
    2. Create a new project.
    3. Build a database (select the free option).
    4. Create a cluster. Choose any provider and region.
    5. Enter a username and password to authenticate your connection. Save this password for later.
    6. Add your current IP to the "IP Access List" to complete the database creation process.
4. On the "Database Deployments" page in MongoDB, click Connect > Connect your application. Save the application code for later.
5. From your local project directory, enter the config folder and create a `.env` file.
6. Inside the file, paste the following: `DB_STRING = <MongoDB application code>`. Enter the application code where indicated.
7. Inside the application code is `<password>`. Replace it with the password from earlier.
8. In the terminal, enter `npm start` to run the local server. Access it via `http://localhost:8000/`.
